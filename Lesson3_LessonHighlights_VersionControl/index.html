            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The first question that comes to mind is what is version control? It's one of the main repository for all the project files that you need back up. It's also where some team members check out their files, make the necessary changes, and check them back in or commit them back to the server. Doing this helps solve the file sharing problem and also makes it easy for the team members to find a place to do their work. This makes it easy and helpful for teams that do not work in the same place do their work easier and make the changes that need to be made.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Now that we know what version control does, how does this make version control system work? The thing is that the system already notes who changed the files, when they were changed, what about them was new or different, and then merge the new changes to the files. Some of the benefits of the version contol system is that the files can never be overwritten, there is a common place for the files to be like a repository, people can work on the same files at the same time without any types of conflict, allows you to go to old files if it's needed, and lastly the version contol system will backup the files so that you never lose them.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">During this lesson, a common question to myself was what is git? How does it work? Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is designed to handle everything from the smallest to the huge and the enormous files with great speed and great efficiency. Some people say that git is very easy to learn and has some of fastest services around. It is also might be the easy to use as the website that it is on has a web page designated to help people learn about git and how to be able to use this system whenever they needed to.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Why Use Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">So now that we have an understanding what git is, the next question is why should people use git? Git is a distributed version control system that every user has a complete copy of the data stored locally onto their own machines. Now that everything is local, so you can work off it anytime you need to and make the changes that are necessary. With git, there is no single point of failure, so you know that trust the git and it's system. With git, things processes at a much faster pace. With git, it will prevent an unintentional overwritten files so that no one can go in and rewrite over your files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using git, a person is going to have use some commands in order to make the git system work. There are the basic commands that do the most basic stuff from git such as git init, git add --all, git commit -am which is the initial commit, git log, and git status. Then after that there are some more complicated commands, some of which can be from a remote location, commands such as git remote, git pull, and git push. These commands make using git and git hub a lot easier and makes it so that anyone can use the git version control system. </p>
